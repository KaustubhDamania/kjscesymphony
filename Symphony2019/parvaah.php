                Parvaah is the social initiative of K. J. Somaiya College of
                Engineering and was born out of the need to give back to the

                    Under the initiative of health and sanitation, and in
                    accordance with the government’s Swacch Bharat Abhiyan,
                    Parvaah has undertaken the task of beautifying Versova
                    beach. Along with long-time crusader Mr. Afroz Shah who is
                    acknowledged as a United Nations’ Champion of the Earth,
                    Parvaah has organized weekend cleanup drives at Versova
                    beach. It’s an attempt to restore the pride of the beach and
                    make it pristine again. If one wants to bring about a
                    change, then it must come from within oneself, and this is a
                    wonderful opportunity to restore the pride of the city and
                    send a message to the society regarding importance of
                    cleanliness.
